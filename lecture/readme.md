Why use nested data structures?
Hashes represent "things" or ideas well, things that have properties or related paris of things
Arrays hold lists of things
When you combine them you have a powerful way to hold lists of ideas

What are the scoping implications of nested data structures?
-modifying one piece modifies the larger whole (intuitive)
-variables overwriting other variables (naming block variables the same as another variable)

How do we iterate inside an iteration?

How do we deal with the case where we want to insert something into an array but the first time there exists no array, or increment a counter in a hash
